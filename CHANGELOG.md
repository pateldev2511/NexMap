# Changelog

All notable changes to NexMap are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). NexMap is pre-1.0, so
minor/patch semantics are not yet enforced.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Flat 2D device-model icons (detailed, per-type) distinct from the 3D
  isometric models; the library palette and flat-mode export track the active
  projection.
- FossFLOW-style floating info card above nodes (name + sanitized rich-text
  description) with a dotted leader; on-canvas inline rename.
- 2D vs ISO visual differentiation: grounded shadows in iso (flat stays flat),
  an iso stage vignette, cable-on-floor connector shadows, and an animated tilt
  on projection toggle.
- Positioned vendor/model/role combobox; per-node icon-size and label-height
  controls.
- 18 grouped starter templates (Home & small office, Enterprise & data center).
- Group move carries a connector's waypoints when both endpoints move.
- Cloudflare Workers + Pages deployment config (`wrangler.toml`, `_headers`,
  deploy scripts); live at https://nexmap.xyz.
- Generated README/social visuals from the export pipeline
  (`npm run gen:readme-media`) including a 1200×630 Open Graph card.
- Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions): lint, test, build, and Cloudflare
  config validation on every PR and push to `main`.
- Project governance: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
  issue/PR templates.

### Fixed

- Info card no longer swallows connector clicks (foreignObject is click-through).
- Vendor/model/role dropdown now anchors correctly under its input.
